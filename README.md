# ðŸ“¬ Event Notification System (ENS)

A Java Spring Bootâ€“based **Event Notification System** that accepts incoming events (EMAIL, SMS, PUSH), queues them via RabbitMQ, processes them asynchronously, and posts a callback response to the provided `callbackUrl`.

## âœ… Features

- Accepts events via REST endpoint: `POST /api/events`
- Validates inputs using Jakarta Bean Validation
- Sends events to dedicated RabbitMQ queues: `email.queue`, `sms.queue`, `push.queue`
- Processes events asynchronously with simulated delays
- Randomly fails 10% of events to simulate error scenarios
- Sends callback to the provided URL with status (`Completed` / `Failed`)
- Graceful shutdown support
